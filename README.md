# Project_Kojak
Passion project from Metis Data Science Bootcamp

## Worklist
Here is my checklist of things to do:
* Engineer by meal nutritional statistics and implement in model
* Use final month as holdout set to test final models against
* Add R^2 into cross validation to check
* Retrain my model using the final regression chosen and run on holdout test set to get final R^2 and RMSE
* Determine forecasting vs prediction
* Start working on Yummly data to make recommendations based on calorie goals
* Integrate into flask app using tableau as well

## Forecasting Goals

* Predict tomorrow's weight based on today's weight and nutritional intake/activity
* Have feature to predict 1 week/1 month/X months in the future by inputting an expected calorie/macronutrient/activity goal (with confidence interval)
* Food recommender for the next meal/couple meals based on calorie/macronutrient goal and current caloric intake
